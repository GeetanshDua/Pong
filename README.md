I am new to C++ just making "Pong" while watching a tutorial for first time.
Using git and github for first time. 
So project structure might not look perfect but try to do better next time.

#Implemented Paddle AI and Player Controller but but but
Paddles goes off screen now.
Player controller is not smooth.


NOTE: Will Start working on this after break.

Thank you,
